## About me
I’m Anusha Ejaz, a former dentist now focused on software quality assurance and testing. Currently, I’m pursuing a graduate certificate in Software and Information Systems Testing at Fanshawe College.
With a strong interest in delivering high-quality software, I’ve worked on projects involving UI automation, API testing, and performance testing using tools such as Selenium WebDriver, JUnit, TestNG, Postman, and JMeter. I also have experience designing and executing test cases, documenting defects, and collaborating in Agile development environments.
My skill set extends into Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATT) practices, ensuring that testing aligns closely with user expectations and business goals. I’m also familiar with Figma for reviewing and validating UI/UX designs from a testing perspective.
I'm continuously learning and expanding my skills in areas like Java, automation frameworks, and version control using Git and GitHub.

### Skills & Tools
Languages: Java, HTML, CSS
Testing Tools: Selenium, JMeter, Postman, TestNG, JUnit
Other Tools: Git, Jenkins, Glowroot, SQL, Figma
Practices: Manual Testing, Automation Testing, Performance Testing, BDD, ATT, Agile Methodologies

### Current Focus
Strengthening Java programming and test automation skills
Applying BDD and ATT principles in real-world scenarios
Building a portfolio of QA projects across UI, API, and performance layers

⚡ Fun fact: I transitioned from dentistry to software testing, and now I break code instead of teeth!
